## [Unreleased]

## [0.18.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **AV1 Hardware Acceleration:** Added support for NVIDIA's AV1 hardware encoder (`av1_nvenc`) for compatible RTX 40-series GPUs. Integrated with the existing quality slider for consistent VBR control.
- **Hardware Encoder Controls:** The video panel now exposes NVENC-specific AQ toggles (spatial and temporal) and a software-fallback switch for VideoToolbox, mirroring the new ffmpeg flag support.

### Changed

- **Preset Awareness:** Hardware encoders now only show presets they actually accept, and NVENC selections are automatically mapped to valid ffmpeg preset names to prevent failed launches with legacy user presets.
- **FFmpeg Argument Builder:** Updated to emit the correct hardware flags (`-cq:v`/AQ options for NVENC, `-allow_sw` for VideoToolbox) and to skip unsupported parameters like `-preset` for VideoToolbox, ensuring conversions no longer fail when switching between software and hardware encoders.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **Preview Panel:** Enhanced the video playback overlay with interactive behavior.
  - **Dynamic Overlay:** The play/pause overlay now automatically appears on hover during playback and remains visible when paused.
  - **Animated Transitions:** Implemented smooth Svelte fade transitions for the overlay and playback controls.
  - **Contextual Icons:** The overlay button now dynamically toggles between Play and Pause icons based on the current playback state.

### Fixed

- **Preview Panel:** Resolved a frame flickering issue where the video would jump back to the start frame while adjusting the trim handles. The playback loop logic is now suppressed during active dragging to ensure a smooth frame preview.

### Changed

- **Icon System:** Migrated the entire application icon set from `lucide-svelte` to Phosphor Icons.
- **Icon Architecture:** Implemented a central icon management system in `src/lib/icons` using a standardized "internal naming" convention (e.g., `IconPlay`, `IconTrash`, `IconClose`). This decouples UI components from specific libraries and simplifies future icon set swaps.
- **Performance:** Converted all raw SVG icons into native Svelte 5 components with support for reactive `size` and `class` properties.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Windows Titlebar:** Introduced a dedicated titlebar component for Windows, replacing the previously shared Linux titlebar. This provides a more native look and feel on Windows systems.
- **Dynamic Font Switching:** Added the ability to toggle between Geist Mono and Geist Sans fonts across the entire application.
  - **New Visual Setting:** Added a font family selector in the App Settings under the Visuals section.
  - **Persistence:** The chosen font preference is saved and automatically applied on subsequent launches.
- **Subtitle Support:** Comprehensive handling of subtitle tracks within the application.
  - **Soft-subs:** Added ability to select and passthrough existing subtitle tracks from the source file. By default, all tracks are preserved if none are explicitly selected.
  - **Hard-subs (Burn-in):** Support for burning in external subtitle files (`.srt`, `.ass`, `.vtt`) directly into the video stream. The process includes automatic path escaping for cross-platform compatibility.

### Changed

- **UI:** Replaced text-based setting tabs with intuitive icon-based buttons (Source, Output, Video, Audio, Metadata, Presets) for a cleaner and more compact interface.
- **Documentation:** Updated README with Linux system requirements for AppImage users.

### Fixed

- **macOS Dialog Reparenting:** Native file dialogs are now spawned from an invisible helper window so the main HUD window keeps its rounded corners while the picker is open, eliminating the rectangular flash that previously appeared when the dialog borrowed the app window.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Smart Scaling (Letterbox/Pillarbox):** Implemented intelligent scaling for custom resolutions. When both width and height are specified (e.g., in 4K or Social presets), the application now maintains the original aspect ratio by adding black bars (padding) instead of stretching the video.
- **Social Media Presets:** Added 6 new built-in presets for YouTube (1080p, 4K), X (Landscape, Portrait), TikTok/Reels, and Discord, optimized according to 2025 platform recommendations.
- **HEVC Hardware Acceleration:** Added support for H.265 (HEVC) hardware encoding via `hevc_videotoolbox` (Apple Silicon/Intel) and `hevc_nvenc` (NVIDIA).
- **Smart Encoder Detection:** The application now dynamically scans `ffmpeg` capabilities at startup to only show encoders supported by the user's hardware (e.g., hiding NVENC on macOS or VideoToolbox on Windows), replacing the previous static OS-based filtering.

### Changed

- **Code Architecture:** Refactored the Interactive Crop Tool logic into a dedicated utility module (`crop.ts`), improving maintainability and component readability.

### Fixed

- **Preset Matching:** Improved the logic for identifying the "Applied" preset in the UI by including video bitrate, custom resolution dimensions, and bitrate mode in the comparison, resolving an issue where multiple presets would appear as selected simultaneously.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Batch Preset Application:** Added a new "Apply to All" button in the Presets tab. This allows users to instantly apply a selected preset to all pending files in the queue after a confirmation dialog, significantly speeding up batch configuration workflows.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed

- **CI/CD:** Switched the Linux AMD64 build runner to `ubuntu-24.04` and pinned specific WebKitGTK versions to resolve `EGL_BAD_PARAMETER` errors when running the AppImage on modern Linux distributions like Arch/CachyOS.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Interactive Crop Tool:** A powerful new tool for cropping videos directly in the preview panel.
  - **Visual Composition:** Includes a draggable area with a rule-of-thirds (3x3) grid overlay and various aspect ratio presets (Free, 1:1, 16:9, etc.).
  - **Auto-Zoom:** Automatically zooms and centers the preview on the cropped area after application to ensure pixel-perfect inspection.
  - **Robust Transformations:** Fully integrates with rotation and flip controls. The crop coordinates automatically adapt to video orientation changes, and interaction handles remain intuitive (mouse direction matches visual movement) even when the video is rotated or mirrored.

### Changed

- **Dashboard layout:** Split the left column into a 12-row grid so the trim preview card permanently occupies the top section while the file list sits below it. This removes the floating trim modal and gives the timeline controls dedicated real estate.
- **Trim workflow:** The trimming card now applies start/end changes immediately (no Save/Cancel buttons) and is always visible with the selected file, providing constant video preview and faster adjustments without opening overlays.
- **Transform controls:** Rotation and flip moved out of the Video tab and into the preview card as icon-only buttons, with rotation cycling through 0/90/180/270° on each click for quicker access while adjusting trims.
- **Localization:** Linux titlebar buttons now use the same translated strings as the macOS variant (no more hard-coded English labels).
